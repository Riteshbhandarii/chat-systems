    <h2>About UmbraChat</h2>
    <p>Hello there! I'm a second-year Data Engineering student, and UmbraChat is a school project I've developed for my Big Data Engineering course. The goal of this project was to apply the principles and technologies learned in the curriculum to build a real-world application that handles data efficiently and scalably.</p>

    <p>You might notice UmbraChat embraces the aesthetics of the night. As a fellow night owl, I find that dark mode isn't just a preference; it's a way of life. Plus, it seemed fitting for a platform where connections spark even after the sun goes down.</p>

    <p>UmbraChat is designed to be a secure and reliable messaging platform, focusing on the backend infrastructure required to manage a potentially large volume of messages and user interactions. This project allowed me to delve deep into the challenges and solutions associated with big data in a communication context.</p>

    <div class="skills-box">
        <h3>Skills Used</h3>
        <p>The development of UmbraChat and my related coursework has involved the use of the following skills and technologies:</p>

        <h3>Privacy and Security</h3>
        <p>Security and user privacy are important considerations for UmbraChat:</p>
        <ul class="privacy-security-list">
            <li>
                <strong>Secure Password Handling:</strong> User passwords are securely handled using Django's built-in <a
                    href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/auth/#how-django-handles-passwords"
                    target="_blank">password hashing mechanisms</a>. This ensures that sensitive information is never stored in
                plain text.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Minimal User Information:</strong> In adherence to principles similar to <a
                    href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank">GDPR</a>, UmbraChat is designed to collect and store only the
                minimal amount of user information necessary for the core functionality of the messaging platform.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>User Control over Messages:</strong> Users have the option to delete their own messages, providing control
                over their communication history and enhancing privacy.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Personalized User Experience:</strong> Upon login, UmbraChat loads and displays the user's own information,
                such as their username or any relevant profile details, ensuring a personalized and relevant experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>GDPR Compliance and Consent:</strong> To comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), users
                are required to explicitly consent to the <a href="{% url 'privacy_policy' %}">Privacy Policy</a> during the
                registration process. This ensures that users are informed about how their data is processed and have given
                their agreement.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Privacy Policy Accessibility:</strong> A clear and comprehensive <a href="{% url 'privacy_policy' %}">Privacy
                    Policy</a> is readily accessible to all users, outlining the data collected, its usage, and users' rights
                regarding their personal data.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Building UmbraChat: Technical Details</h3>
        <p>The architecture of UmbraChat incorporates several key components to handle messaging efficiently:</p>
        <ul class="skills-list" style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 20px;">
            <li>
                <strong>Real-time Communication:</strong> UmbraChat utilizes <strong>WebSockets</strong> for bidirectional, real-time
                communication between users and the server. This allows for instant message delivery without the need for
                constant polling.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Asynchronous Handling:</strong> <strong>Django Channels</strong> extends Django's capabilities to handle
                WebSockets and other asynchronous tasks. It provides the framework for managing connections and message
                routing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>WebSocket Server:</strong> <strong>Daphne</strong> serves as the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway
                Interface) server to handle incoming WebSocket connections and pass them to Django Channels for processing.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Message Brokering and Caching:</strong> <strong>Redis</strong> is used as a message broker to facilitate
                communication between different parts of the application, especially for handling WebSocket messages. It can
                also be used for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Backend API:</strong> The backend of UmbraChat is built with <strong>Django</strong>, providing a robust
                framework for handling user authentication, message creation, retrieval, and other core functionalities
                through RESTful APIs.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Data Storage:</strong> Chat messages and user data are stored in <strong>PostgreSQL (psql)</strong>, a
                robust and scalable relational database known for its reliability and performance. The schema is optimized for
                efficient querying of conversations.
            </li>
        </ul>
